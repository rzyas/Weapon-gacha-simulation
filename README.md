# Weapon-gacha-simulation
I made a simple code using Vanilla JS (gacha system) with the following rates: chance of getting regular items (white-bg) / zonk: 250% chance of getting rare items (blue-bg): 130% chance of getting a unique item (purple-bg): 35% chance of getting super items (red-bg): 5%  All weapons are 3D models which you can see at: https://sketchfab.com/rzyas
